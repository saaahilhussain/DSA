# Data Structure and Algorithms using C++

This repository serves as a personal documentation of my progress, covering various data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques implemented in C++.

Sources: Striver's A2Z Sheet, Rohit Negi's DSA Playlist and some problem statements from GFG.

## Topics Covered
- ✅ C++ Basics
- ✅ Arrays & Strings
- ✅ Stacks & Queues
- ✅ Recursion & Backtracking
- ✅ Sorting & Searching Algorithms

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Tools:** VS Code, g++, Git & GitHub
- **Resources:** Online courses, books, and coding platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks)

## How to Navigate 
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/saaahilhussain/DSA
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired topic folder.
3. Run the C++ programs using:
   ```sh
   g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output
   ```

## Future Plans
